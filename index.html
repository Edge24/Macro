  Dear Supplier,
  <br>
  Greetings from Meesho.
  <br>
  <br>
  For reverse logistic service, please note that we have enabled the option for you to choose the preferred courier partners to receive the customer return shipments. On the 'Returns' page in the Supplier Panel, you can select your preferred courier partner under the tab 'Courier Partner'.
  <br>
  <br>
  Please use this feature for deprioritizing the logistic partner instead of blocking as going forward we would not be blocking the logistics partner for maximum serviceability
  <br>
  <br>
  For forward logistic service, under the new policy, the courier partner may be deprioritized and won't receive shipment allocations for pickups. However, if other courier partners are unavailable, we may assign the deprioritized courier partner to prevent order cancellations. This change aims to improve order fulfillment efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  To deprioritize the 3PL for forward services, please raise a new ticket following the below steps: Supplier Panel-Support-Help-Orders & Delivery-I want to change my courier partner
